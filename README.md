# egraph

- Machine learning crate to how to use the population variant data from the eVai predictions or the other variants for the machine learning and predicts and confirm where the variant data is not annotated with respect to the previous population. 
- See the test files as how to prepare the data for the variant classification.
- a complete classification on the variants coming from the population so that you can confirm any unanotated variant or even check.
- This allows for the classification of the variants where a population has been studied and you want to implicit a classification model. rewaq	1`	2	 `
